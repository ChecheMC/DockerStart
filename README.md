# DockerStart
This is mi start in docker with introduccion and Docker guides.

Hi, I'm Michelzon, or as I prefer to be called, Cheche. Here I'll be writing about and showing my progress and what I'm able to do with Docker, since I'm interested in learning it and seeing if it can help me in cybersecurity, as that's what I want to dedicate myself to.

**I'll start by creating an NGINX container** :smiley:

**Commands**
-d → Detached mode (running in the background)

-p 8080:80 → Your PC port 8080 → Container port 80

nginx → NGINX web server image
